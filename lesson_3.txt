When would you want to use a remote repository ranther than keeping all your work local?

This will allow for backups as well as allowing others to work on the system. Lastly it will allow a central place to have the changes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autimatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?

This way any discrepencies will be managed. Files won't be changed without knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are better versions of clones that are on the GitHub. Should be used when modifing someone elses code for personal use. Clones are copies and be used to migrate or to fork a project. Branches splits from the master. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This will allow you to do a clean merge and see what changes have been made on the remote without yet merging.
