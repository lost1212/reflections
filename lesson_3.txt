When would you want to use a remote repository ranther than keeping all your work local?

This will allow for backups as well as allowing others to work on the system. Lastly it will allow a central place to have the changes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autimatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?

This way any discrepencies will be managed. Files won't be changed without knowledge.
